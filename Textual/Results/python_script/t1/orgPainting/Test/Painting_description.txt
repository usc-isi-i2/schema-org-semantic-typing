When I saw Svitlana's portrait of a girl with flowers in her hair I was reminded of my first ever 'big' portrait in oil.  Unfortunately it was damaged when out on exhibition.  It has a permanent home now with me.

One day I had painted a bunch of keys on a canvas, my bunch of keys. I didnt know what to put next to them. I needed something that would be the absolute opposite of a bunch of keys. So when I finished work I went out. I had only walked a few yard when what should I see in a shop windows A postcard of the Mona Lisa! At once I knew that was what I needed; what could have made a greater contrast to the keys. ..Then I also added a can of sardines. It was such a strong contrast. \nLa vie fait de lOeuvre de Fernand Lger, Dora Vallier, Cahiers dArt, 2, 1954, p. 153

Mondrian also experimented with other art forms before settling on his own neo-plastic form, including post-impressionism, pointillism, and cubism, the latter of which this is an example. This piece contains interlocking blocks, which form together in the shape of a tree. But unlike cubist artists from whom he took his cue, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, Mondrian had yet to merge his artistic style with his spiritual pursuits, and as such this was only one of a few of such cubist experiments. Mondrian still had a few years to go before he would begin to fins his real voice as an artist, although one could argue that his style was ever-changing, culminating in his masterpieces in his later years of life.

Acrylic paints on canvas for sale. Size 48\" X 48\".Inspired by the colours of the Male Indian Blue Peacock. The male is actually called the \"Peacock\" and the female a \"Peahen\". The male will display its beautiful plumage when trying to get the attention of a certain female. It is the national bird of India.
This painting is \"Golden Forest\" by Carolyn Reynolds. I love the forest layering over another. I think the black layer over the golden layer is the key to what makes this painting so lovely. The tree leaves are painted ever so lightly, with a dab effect, I'm sure. The fact that Carolyn didn't use much detail on the leaves, brings so much more focus to the golden center. This is a wonderful piece of art.

This painting was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain, upon Goyas suggestion, to commemorate the invasion of Spain by Napoleons troops in 1808. At the time it was painted, the painting was considered groundbreaking and revolutionary, as it presents the horrors of war that had heretofore not been openly illustrated. The painting focuses on one man, illuminated in white light in the middle of the painting, arms held out to the sides, facing a French firing squad. His slain companions litter the ground. It is thus considered one of the first pieces of modern art. This painting has influence a number of other artists, who have directly referenced the style and setting of the painting, including Edouard Manet and Pablo Picasso.

The piece of art depicts a black dog (labrador / black lab) against a cool blue background. The dog is balancing a full beer glass on his nose. The dog has a red collar on. The Black Dog Brewing Company series would be great for a basement, bar or restaurant. The grainy feel of the art really gives the room a nice touch.

The art depicts a sign posted to a sectioned wood background. The background has many cool blue and green colors. The paint appears to be chipped. This picture would be at home in a bathroom or at the beach. The sign the middle says the word Relax in the center.
I would like to thank everyone for their continued support and helpful feedback.. I really really appreciate it..: )x Again this is very much experimental with textures.. It's for a friend who believes in Angels.. Do you think the wings look right Any crits or comments are always welcome.. Thankyou..: )x

Magritte created two versions of this painting, of the same name, which both portray a large green apple in the middle of a room. This painting illustrates the many themes running through Magrittes work. The first is the apple, which he uses to great lengths in many of his works, the most famous of which is The Son of Man, depicting a man wearing a bowling hat, with a green apple covering his face. The other theme is that of placing objects together in an unusual context. Unlike other surrealist artists, who mixed dreamlike images with abstract shapes, Magrittes works included normal images, placed in surreal contextual situations. The Listening Room is one such painting, portraying a regular green apple, which just so happens to be large enough to fill and entire room.

Oil on Canvas, 14\" x 11\" For sale.She is a combination of different traditions of myth and deity... She came to me out of an organic process and introduced herself as a \"Candela\" or Eventide (High) Fairy.. I am happy to learn (and now I remember) that this posture is similar to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth.  High Fairies are like angels and goddesses both, are less mischievous than other fairies, and actually help as overseers of other fairies. Candelas are very fond of humans and are skilled in healing human bodies..they travel the globe mainly at night and bring comfort and peace to the humans whom they visit. There are often unexplained healings whenever a Candela has anonymously paid a visit to an ailing human.. I believe they also bestow good fortune on their human hosts as well..which would explain her Lakshmi-like pose. Her \"wings\" were another intuitive gesture that I later understood as the Eye of Horus, only abstracted to create a sort of windblown hairstyle that denotes psychic vision. This entire painting was a clairvoyant experience that filled me with immense peace and pleasure. :))  Also, her hairstyle is also all about light...as if she is lit up like a candle. Candelas tend to glow like fireflies as they travel..

Although the majority of what Corot produced was landscapes, he did produce a number of portraits as well. This painting is a bit of both, as it depicts a man in a boat in the background of a woman reading. In his later years, Corot created many such paintings of solitary women reading, yet this was the only one that he exhibited during his lifetime. Perhaps his obsession with solitary women had something to do with the fact that he remained without a wife his entire life. Early on in his painting career, he wrote that he was devoted to a lifetime of painting, and therefore did not have time for marriage.

A drawing of my husband.
The Mona Lisa (La Gioconda or La Joconde, or Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world.\"\n\nThe painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Muse du Louvre in Paris. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.
One of the most famous paintings both by De Chirico and of all metaphysical art, The Disquieting Muses was painted in the city of Ferrara, Italy, during World War I. De Chirico considered Ferrara a perfect metaphysical city, and used much of the cityscape of Ferrara in the painting. The large castle in the background is the Castello Estense, a medieval fortress in the center of the city. The three muses, in the foreground of the painting, are disquieting due to the fact that they were the pathway to overcome appearances and allowed the viewer to engage in a discourse with the unknown. This painting inspired a poem by Sylvia Plath, also entitled The Disquieting Muses.

Edgar Allen Poe published his poem The Raven in 1845, and although it did not bring the writer much money, it did bring him much fame. The poem became very popular, and it soon became republished, printed, illustrated, and parodied all throughout culture. Gustave Dores illustrations of the poems are an example of the response to the poem. Dores illustrations to the poem appeared in an independent publication in 1884, almost forty years after the original was published. Unfortunately, Dore was never able to see these illustrations in print, as he died before it was published. It remains one of the most famous poems ever written.

Although he created many serious works for epic poems by great authors, Dore also illustrated many fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood and Cendrillon, or Cinderella. The story of Cinderella was just as much a cultural influence in the 19th century as it is today, as it is a story of unjust circumstances and the human ability to hope that magic can help us overcome those circumstances. It was in the 19th century that the Brothers Grimm wrote the version of the story that was widely popular at the time. Their large compilation of their fairy tales was first published in 1812, and numerous editions followed the first for the next throughout the 19th century, all of which were extensively illustrated, including works from Gustave Dore.

24 X 36 in. Oil on canvasI'm taking a break from Global Warming for a bit because I was inspired by a heart-warming sea story that just came in my way. I love doing paintings after stories. Yes, I was inspired by a (whale of a tail)story made into a movie that just came out this year. The movie \"Big Miracle.\" I love whales and think they are beautiful, gentle, peaceful, and the most magnificent creatures on this planet. This story is about Gray Whales. Gray whales are extremely peaceful and friendly animals. They are very much like us. They are very social and family oriented. They care for their family members, especially for their babies. They will not leave a family member if they are in danger or hurt, or sick. The are also curious. I've heard that they come up to you and want to check you out. Whales are truly the Gentle giants of the sea. Gray whales grow close to 50 feet ( 12-14 meters) and weigh up to 35 tons. Grays travel one of the longest migrations of any animal every year. They swim 12, 400 miles (20,000 km) from their feeding grounds in the Bering Sea to the lagoons of Mexico's Baja California. Timing is extremely important to them, they must leave their feeding grounds fast or the sea ice can trap them near the coastal waters. It is a natural thing that sometimes broken pieces of ice forms around the whales where they become \"trapped\" (surrounded by ice)in the center of the ice. The pieces stick together again and freeze, locking the whales within. Most of the time, whales die this way. You see, whales are just like humans in this way that when we are under water, we must come up to the surface for air. Whales have a \"blow hole/blowholes\" on the tops of their heads. These are nostrals actually. Toothed whales (like dolphins, Orcas or Killer whales, Sperm whales, Balugas, etc.) have a single blow hole. Whales without teeth (such as these Gray Whales, Humpbacks, Blue Whales, Fin Whales, Right whales, etc.) but have baleen (a type of natural seive or filter)have two blowholes. Just like humans, all whales and dolphins must come up to the surface to breath using their blowholes. In October 1988, three Gray Whales, a mother, father, and their calf became trapped off the coast of Barrow, Alaska on their annual journey. Since they were so far from the open ocean, this whale family had no way to travel under the ice so far. There was no place to come up to breath. Local Inupiat (eskimos)hunters (whale hunters)who do have a respect and love for whales had second thoughts to try and save these beautiful whales instead of eating them which is their ancient way of survival. Usually these people hunt \"Right Whales,\" Grays are an exception. The Inupiat hunters cut a pathway of \"breathing holes\" in the ice using chainsaws that led all the way to the open ocean. These people worked so hard, cutting the holes days and nights through temps below freezing. Because of the freezing temperatures, the previous holes kept freezing over again so a company was sent over with a device to keep circulating the water preventing it from freezing. Luckily, the devices noise actually attracted the whales which helped lure them to the next breathing hole ahead. This event brought the Soviet Union and the United States together in cooperation to save the whales. The Soviets used an Ice breaker to cut a miles-long path to make it easier for the whales. The people then helped the whales by guiding them the easiest way possible through the jumbled pieces of ice left behind by the ice breakers. Then the whales could continue on their journey. Unfortunately, despite all the long, tedious process, one of the whales didn't make it to the open ocean. Only two of them survived. The movie shows that the calf died, but in real life, it only mentions one of them died-it doesn't say which one. Naturally, we would think the baby, since babies are a little weaker and depend on their parents for everything just like human babies. Throughout this rescue effort, somehow the whales seemed to know that man was helping them. I saw the movie, which was pretty good. I do feel that the events in real life must have been much more exciting and dramatic. BIG MIRACLE, Feb. 2012...now in theaters.

When Impression, Sunrise hung at its first exhibition in 1874, art critic Louis Leroy derisively used the term Impressionistic, from the title of this painting, to describe Monets works. This term was quickly adopted by what were soon to be known as the Impressionist painters, and the exhibition which included other works by Impressionist artists, was from then on referred to as the Impressionist Exhibition. This painting was later stolen in 1985 from the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris, but was recovered undamaged in 1990, and was put back on display at the museum in 1991.

A master of compelling performance pieces, Beuys flew to New York, picked up by an ambulance, and swathed in felt, was transported to a room in the Rene Block Gallery. The room was also occupied by a wild coyote, and for a period of 8 hours a day for the next three days, Beuys spent his time with the coyote in the small room, with little more than a felt blanket and a pile of straw. While in the room, the artist engaged in symbolist gestures, such as striking a triangle and tossing his gloves to the coyote. At the end of the three days, the coyote, who had become quite tolerant of Beuys, allowed a hug from the artist, who was transported back to the airport via ambulance. He never set foot on outside American soil nor saw anything of America other than the coyote and the inside of the gallery.

After that, well, what can you do Especially if you're like 30 years old and singing about school. It's got to be difficult to dredge up any kind of enthusiasm. I probably listened to that album a thousand times, that and Killer. When I was 13 years old I thought I would listen to those records every day, forever. But I haven't heard an Alice Cooper record in 30 years. Who failed, me or Alice Only the philosophers know for sure.

This is the third version of one of Friedrich's most famous paintings, of which the first (1819) is in the Gemldegalerie, Dresden, and the second (ca. 1824) is in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (17941822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.\nAlthough the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.

Although many people think of apples as a New England commodity, J. A. Apple Butter Making is actually among a handful of paintings based on Moses' Virginia memories. The house in the picture is the Dudley Place, one of several farms the Moses family occupied as tenants during their years down South.\n\n\"Late summer was the time for apple butter making,\" Moses wrote in her autobiography. \"The apple butter was considered a necessity.\"\n\nTo make apple butter, you take two barrels of sweet cider {you grind apples and make sweet cider first), then you put them on in a big brass kettle over afire out in the orchard and start it to boiling. You want three barrels of quartered apples, or snits, as they called them, with cores taken out, and then you commence to feed those in, and stirring and keeping that stirrer going. . . . Womenfolks would keep that going, feeding in all the apples until evening. Then the young folks would come in to start stirring. They'd have twoa boy and a girlto take hold of the handle. They'd have a regular frolic all night out in the orchard.\n\nMoses' personal recollectionsparts of which read like recipes, others like social historywere mirrored in the content of her painting.

Optimistic about the Russian Revolution, Malevich thought that the newfound freedom wound open the door to a new society, where materialism allowed for spiritual freedom. In his efforts, he studied aerial photography, and this painting is an effort make the the top square seem as if it is floating above the canvas. The stark canvas on White on White it is not devoid of emotion or deep artistic sentiment. Malevichs brushstrokes are evident, and the soft outlines of the imprecise square make the white austerity of the painting seem more human. When it was created, it was one of the most radical paintings of its day, without reference to any outside reality.

The Four Seasons is the last set of four oil canvases painted by Poussin between the years of 1660 and 1664, for the son of the Cardinal Richelieu, Duc de Richelieu. They were created during Poussins last years of life, during which he suffered hand tremors, which made the execution of the paintings slow and painful, turning Poussin into a virtual recluse. The images in the paintings reflect a philosophical interpretation of the outside world, depicting the power and might of nature. As well as the four seasons, they also revolve through the four times of day: early morning, midday, evening, and moonlight. All four paintings (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) currently reside in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where they enjoy their own room.

This is Paul Gaugins most famous painting, and he considered it his masterpiece, and the culmination of his thoughts. In Tahiti, as he was painting his masterpiece, Gaugin declared that he would commit suicide upon its completion. Although this was something he had previously attempted, this was not the case, as the artist died of syphilis in 1903. The painting was meant to be read from right to left, with the three main figures in the painting representing the three questions of the title. The figures are arranged from the beginning stages of life, from young figures with a child, to the middle aged figure in the middle, to the elder figure on the left of the painting. The idol in the background, situated behind the elder figure, represents the Beyond.

John Miltons epic poem Paradise Lost, describing the Christian story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the ensuing fall of man, is considered one of the greatest pieces of literature in the English language. It has inspired many visual artists to engage in creating the imagery of the poem. The first illustrated version of the poem appeared in the fourth edition of the work, in 1688, and later, other artists, such as William Blake and Salvador Dali have been inspired to create illustrations inspired by the work. Dores illustrations of Paradise Lost were some of his later works, and also some of the most famous.

Oamaru is a town on the East coast of New Zealand with beautiful historic buildings built from the local sandstone known as Oamaru Stone. The Town Hall in this watercolour is no exception. I was pleased with the simplicity and freedom of this rendition, especially the trees.
