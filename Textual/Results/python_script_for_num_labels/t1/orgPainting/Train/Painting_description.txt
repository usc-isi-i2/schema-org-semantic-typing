The Birth of Venus, one of the most recognized paintings by Botticelli, depicts Venus, the goddess of love, born out of a seashell, a fully mature woman. It is worthy to note that in classical times, the seashell was the symbol for the female genitalia, and as such, Botticelli was artfully referencing the goddesss actual birth. Although a mythical figure, there is no exact literary context depicting the scene painted by Botticelli, leading to much speculation. As to its commission, the painting was solicited by a member of the Medici family, which is thought wanted to have a reproduction of an earlier work by a different artist, which had been lost after the rule of Nero.  
El nacimiento de Venus, una de las pinturas ms reconocidas de Botticelli, reprersenta el nacimiento de la diosa del amor Venus emergiendo de la espuma del mar como una mujer plenamente madura. Vale la pena notar que en la poca clsica, la espuma del mar era el smbolo de los genitales femeninos, y como tal, Botticelli fue ingeniosamente referencia real del nacimiento de la diosa. A pesar de una figura mtica lleva a muchas especulaciones, porque no hay contexto literario exacta que representa la escena pintada por Botticelli. La figura central de Venus en la pintura es muy similar a la escultura de Praxteles de Afrodita.\n

This piece whimsically depicts a black dog flying down a mountain side on a pair of skis. The contrasting colors used really make the art pop from foreground to background. The adventurous little dog and his stylish red scarf stand in wonderful contrast to the snowy white and sky blue background. This piece would look great in a home with a great love of dogs or even hanging on the wall of a cozy ski lounge.

 The title and the content of the work suggest a sort of self-parody, which makes sense considering the late period in Dalis life during which the painting created.  Though Dali generally worked in oil, Hitler Masturbating is a watercolor. Given the looser nature of the medium, it was likely executed more quickly than the majority of Dalis canon.  It also represents a departure from the fabricated automatism of Dalis meticulous photorealism.  The brushstrokes are looser and the landscape more impressionistic.  The painting depicts exactly what the title suggests; the dictator, in full Nazi uniform, sits in an armchair, his back to the viewer amidst a barren snowscape.  His chair appears to morph into a group of horses, the hooves of which still bear resemblance to the chair.  The image evokes Dalis 1942 watercolor Sheep, in which a herd of sheep have their hooves inexplicably replaced by gilded furniture legs.  The transformation from chair to horse evokes the journey of the retired soldier, once on horseback, now on plaid.  It could be argued that the painting is an attempt on Dalis part to humanize Hitler. By depicting him from behind, Dali renders him anonymous, simply a figure engaged in an intensely private yet ubiquitous act.  Given Dalis sense of humor, however, the painting is more likely a dirty joke on Dalis part.  As Hitler masturbates, he looks upon a barren wasteland, an emptiness that resembles the destruction of Europe by his own hand.

The Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who commissioned this painting, loved to have his portrait taken, and is said to have stared on end in rapture at the great masterpieces. He thus had his portrait painted by many of the best artists of his day, including Hans von Aachen, Adrian de Vries, and Giuseppe Arcimboldo. Rudolph had collected such a vast amount of paintings that his collection was one of the greatest in Europe. In his typical style, Arcimboldo created Rudolphs image as the character of Vertumnus, the Roman God of plant life, growth, and the change of seasons, compiled of fresh fruit and vegetables.

another bit of randomness
Many of Courbets early paintings from the 1840s are self-portraits, such as this one. As he had yet to truly develop his realistic painting style, many of these self-portraits are Romantic in style, illustrating the smooth lines and perfection of form of the Romantic school of painting. As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

In this work, twelve water-cooler bottles, silvered to a mirror surface, are each engraved with the name of a different bodily fluid: blood, tears, urine, milk, and more. The piece was inspired, Smith has said, by the medieval book of hours, the volumes of Christian observance that provided \"some kind of meditation, something you could think about or believe in,\" for every hour of the day. Choosing \"fluids everyone knows about that come out of the body,\" Smith found physical substitutes for the intangibles of religious belief. She also created a provocative friction between the scale and uniform shape of the bottles and the intimate and internal processes evoked by the words they bear.\n\nFor Smith, the human body, even more than human consciousness, is \"our primary vehicle for experiencing our lives.\" A more consistent presence in Smith's art than any format or medium (her materials range from concrete to glass, and she has also produced many prints), the body is a widespread concern in the art of the 1980s and 1990s. This focus is partly aesthetic, reflecting a need to break from immediate precedentsthe dematerialized linguistic propositions of Conceptual art, or the hard, machine-made, geometric surfaces of Minimalism. But the period also saw intense public debate on issues of sexuality and health, and on their convergence in the AIDS crisis.

Leyendo unas Cartas Viejas (Reading Old Letters)Paintings are drawn from the heart, ordered in the head and thence do battle with the sluggishness of the hand, with the lack of skill to materialise them. Reading Old Letters is the result of an accumulation of nostalgia. Nostalgia for the scent of a Cadiz seaside town awakening my senses: the scent of the sea, barrels and wine impregnating its streets, streets that recall a colonial past.My thoughts bobble, like the sailboats sheltering in Guadalete on their way towards the sea, with its peculiar and incessant ringing mixed with the quacking of gulls.I was thirteen, and you a year older. With you we crossed the last section of the river to the edge of the beach, into the fall of dusk to see the setting sun. You liked to see how the wind played, entangling my hair, while I liked to listen to you recite poems, some yours and others not, slipping barefoot in the sand and then struggling to put on my braided grass and cloth slippers which you grabbed by the end of the ankle straps and held them behind your back.-When the years pass, no matter what happens, we will always be friends like now, and wherever you are I would like to make you a gift, a rich silken robe, and thus you will shine so handsome in your Spring Fair or any of your painting exhibits - Then I will give you a precious piano, so that you will never stop making music, nor do I want you to ever stop writing. It will reach you without a card, and thus only you will know who has sent it. From my wonderful friendship with the youngest child of Portuense poet Jos\u00E9 Luis Tejada remain, in addition to unforgettable memories, a handful of letters from a vast correspondence that we maintained throughout our years of puberty and adolescence, in which he was already expressing himself as the great literary masters, aiming to become an excellent poet like hits father. These are the letters that I chose to appear on the table. My name and address from those days can be read on them.The old tin box is an ancient family remembrance that belonged to my great-grandfather, Joaqu\u00EDn Gutierrez de Salazar, a colonel in the Navy Medical Corps living in San Fernando (Cadiz); it had been preserved by his son (my grandfather), and the latters oldest daughter, my mother. Curiously enough, it bears my name written in French, one of those whims of destiny or not, because when I received it on loan to me to create this work, it was only once it was already in my hands that I discovered this singular detail. That box did not come from any of his travels to Cuba or the Philippines, or perhaps it did. It was a gift that he received from a friend and medical colleague, a certain Antonio Minguet Leteron or Minguet Cadet, who lived near Barcelona; I am not quite sure which. This open box symbolises the unleashed nostalgia of past times and of what can never be. My grandfather could not enjoy his father, because the latter died when he was only forty days old. Perhaps for that reason he always kept that box as a treasure, for the simple fact of having belonged to his father, and he clung gratefully to his memory and to a legacy of extreme generosity, honesty and humility that he knew how to pass on to whomever he met.Ah. Aged flavours, the lights of ever. Those brushes worked with a rhythm of understanding for all those months. My desire dreams of consolation and my little one,The bride of the man shipped outNever took a siesta.Thus sang Carlos Cano,Heaving, heaving to and fro,the schooner coming from Sanl\u00FAcar on the tide is heaving to and fro on the river.In January 1999 I met Manuel Ruf\u00ED Gibert, of the Batik International art gallery in Seville. In an interview held in Hotel Sevilla Congresos, after examining some other photographs of my paintings, he looked me in the eye and told me that he was ready to give in to his intuition and offer me an opportunity. He indicated to me that the next Seville Contemporary Art Fair might possibly have the theme, Ibero-American Contemporary Art Fair, and that he would commit to providing one wall in his stand just for my work, even knowing that I did not have the economic means to pay for it. I was never able to do so more than with my gratitude and personal effort that I always valued fully. That night, I was kept awake, knowing that my painting was Leyendo unas cartas viejas, in which the furthermost and most recent past and the present had to combine in a nostalgic sequence that opened profound atemporal essences. How Ibero-American was the joint nexus through those letters arriving from that other continent. Letters from Indians to relatives, friends, fianc\u00E9es or spouses; from soldiers in distant lands, from sailors, There was a time when I myself was La novia del embarcao (The bride of the man shipped out), a Merchant Marine Captain from that continent known as America, but that is a story that I will tell another day.Maria Jos\u00E9 Aguilar Gutierrez

One of a series of 28 illustrations I did for this book project for Bill Roberts' Bottle of Smoke Press.\n\nThis is my favorite of the lot because it looks insane. I saw Lynyrd Skynyrd back in the 70s and after the show a friend of mine who was really high kept saying, \"It was great when they released the doves during Free Bird!\" Of course they never released any doves. In fact, the house lights were on during the big Free Bird encore because the show was running long and I guess the union guys were pissed off.

This landscape is unusual in its elevated, almost bird's-eye point of view. Such an angle can be seen as an attempt to look at the world in the Japanese way, natural for an artist obsessed with Japan. However, we cannot speak of serious influence here: Van Gogh's view was individual and came from his own impressions. The dynamism distinguishing this canvas is alien to Far Eastern landscapes. The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole. It is a study from nature. The colouring of the painting and the action of the figures show us that it was executed in autumn, a time when Van Gogh worked not only on the hospital grounds, but outside them as well.

A the title suggests, A Beautiful World represents Grandma Moses' view of ideal harmony between humankind and nature.\n\n\"I like pretty things the best, Moses once told an interviewer. \"What's the use of painting a picture if it isn't something nice So I think real hard till I think of something real pretty, and then I paint it. I like to paint old-time) things, historical landmarks of long ago, bridges, mills, and hostelries, those old-time homes, there are a few left, and they are going fast. I do them all from memory, most of them are daydreams, as it were.\n\nSo much twentieth-century painting has been difficult and pessimistic that some have a tendency to dismiss Moses vision as simplistic. In fact, though, there has been much art throughout history that is accessible and optimistic. All art is in some sense an affirmation of lifean offering of the human spirit, however downtrodden, as proof that our thoughts and feelings are ever precious and sometimes beautiful. This is the essence of Grandma Moses' genius.

Colored pencil. 9.5 in. x15 in. Feb. 1996.I completed this study under the instruction of James Mercadante, perhaps the best drawing instructor in New Jersey. The composition is inspired by Ren\u00E9 Magritte, whose surrealistic pieces juxtapose unrelated objects in an unexpected fashion. The shadow in this piece deliberately creates the sense that the pickle-banana is floating.
24X24 inches. Oil on Black Canvas\n\nThis is the first painting I did on a black gessoed canvas, and also believe it or not, the first painting I did from a photo! Yes, it is true. All my other paintings were done completely by imagination. The photo was from a few stationary items I have by National Geographic (Pen, sticky-notes, mousepad). I loved the photo because of the colors and because I love clownfish. I love how it turned out. My colors are pretty close to the photo...only my colors are more vibrant and sharper, whereas the photo is more dull. I didn't like black canvas because I noticed that I had to paint on my colors 2 or 3 layers to make them bright enough to show up on the black background. I wonder why this is and if anyone can let me know if this happens to them or how to solve this problem I appreciate the help. I did like how you can use the black to create the depth and shadows. Anyway, this reminded me of the Disney film, \"Finding Nemo\" so that's why I named it \"Marlin and Nemo.\" Hope you all like it. Thanks for looking.

William Rush and His Model is the name given to several paintings by Thomas Eakins, one set from 1876-77 and the other from 1908. These works depict the American wood sculptor William Rush in 1808, carving his statue Water Nymph and Bittern for a fountain at Philadelphia's first waterworks. Eakins's interest in William Rush originated from a desire to restore Rush's name to prominence in the history of American art. Eakins taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, of which Rush had been a founder. Eakins was a strong believer in teaching human anatomy, and insisted that his students study from nude models. Since it is unlikely that Rush had employed a nude model for his sculpture of a draped water nymph, the painting may be viewed as Eakins's demonstration of the importance of studying anatomy from nudes.

This is a repainting of my original Three Swords.  The original was one of the first I ever painted, this one is 6 months later on a 24X36 canvas.
This painting tells the story Biblical story of Judith, who saved her people by seducing and beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, which was a common theme in the 16th century. The same story has also been painted by artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Donatello, Artemesia Gentileshi, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna. In typical Caravaggio style, the painting depicts the moment of greatest impact, when Judith, whose emotions ring clear on her distraught face, physically beheads the Assyrian king. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio changed the position of Holofernes head as he was painting, separating it farther from the body.

\n      The privilege of painting is the opportunity of non definition, very close to intuition or unconscious. Things are told, but always opened to a moving interpretation.\nA picture is built as a novel: first there is the conductor thread, present during the whole creation, but going quickly from foreground to a place of support, as a note given to the choir ready to sing. This chord goes through the Whole, giving way to the Rest, variations of all sorts, some full of gracefulness, some of gravity or pain.\nAn undulation around a framework. This framework losing its importance, giving place to the undulation. Union of opposites. The framework is stability, the undulation, uncertainty and adventure. Both together are from a perfect aptness, and from a pure impossibility. They complete themselves and mutually disturb themselves. Often is given to this second one the privilege to be right, face to the world, to go towards the public, to disappoint or attract.\nThe pictures chord is the torment, always indefinable, always moving, changing constantly, and constantly in search of stability. It goes through the world without being seen, and taking beings and things away. Indispensable and dangerous, quietly, it sweeps all away. The serious events happen in silence, without scream, without lamentations. Drama is not theatrical. It nails us in its torment, and it is only when it runs through the world and comes us back, transformed, enriched, fed by its own route, that it seems full of sense.\nHere is the way how a torment, movement, rolling, change, unforeseeable, unknown, becomes a picture, a chord, the stability, the conductor thread, the note A.\nAn artist must always attempt the impossible. The torment may allow, better than everything, to wonder about the border between the individual and the collective. Coming from inside or outside, the torment invades us; it is present to prove us our infinite distance from the Other and our hopeless quest to create the link.\n

Although Repin strayed away from painting historical episodes, he completed Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan in the genre. This painting depicts the historical 16th century story of Ivan the Terrible mortally wounding his son in Ivan in a fit of rage. By far the most psychologically intense of Repins paintings, the Emperors face is fraught with terror, as his son lay quietly dying in his arms, blood dripping down the side of his face, a single tear on his cheek. Repin began thinking about painting this historical episode after the assassination of Alexander II. In an attempt to recall other bloody episodes of Russian history, he painted this piece as a as an expression of his rejection of violence and bloodshed.

Painted on 14x16 watercolour paper in watercolour. This is my painting of a fantastic icon of a woman singer. may have tried but no-one has matched her individual style. And where was her true life bodyguard when she clearly needed help and I don't just mean in the passed couple of years. A beautiful talent lost.

Kahlo was 18 years old when she was involved in a horrific traffic accident, in which an iron rod pierced her abdomen, right foot was crushed, and two vertebrae were fractured, as well as a number of other bones, including eleven fractures in her right leg. As she recovered in a full body cast, her mother brought her a small lap easel, and, with a mirror over her bed, began painting self-portraits. This self-portrait embodies many elements that were in Kahlos artwork, including the themes of isolation, a broken body, and intense suffering and pain. This painting also embodies another one of Kahlos themes, that of two bodies, one of which she is a complete and full bodied woman, and another, reflecting broken insides.

I thought it would be a great idea to ink the intro for the Chance Press book. It was a great idea, and like many great ideas, it was also a tremendous pain in the ass. But I'd said I was going to do it, so I was stuck. \n\nWhen I was finished I made this to send to the goofy kids at Chance Press. I hid it in a stack of unpainted paper the same size, and Jordan almost chopped it up when he was sizing the blank sheets. That would have been cool.
Through his drip action technique, Pollock would create layers upon layers of paint, created in a chaotic assemblage of drips and splashes. Physicists have studied Pollocks canvases, such as Lavender Mist, for fractals, which naturally occur out of chaos. Chaos is defined as an irregularity of motion or shape that naturally arises from deterministic forces (such as painting). Some art scientists, such as Richard Taylor, have determined that the more chaotic Pollocks drippings became, the closer they resembled naturally occurring fractals, and that his chronologically later paintings displayed these characteristics more so than his earlier works, which were less chaotic.

Munch created many works in a thematic vein, including The Kiss, and exhibited them along side each other in what he called The Freize of Life. The themes in the series ranged from love and death, sex, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy and the stages of life, and included the famous painting The Scream. This painting captures an intimate moment between two nudes, the woman pulling the man towards her in a lovers embrace, mouths locked in a passionate kiss, and is an example of Munchs theme of the femme fatal as the dominant creature, taking control to feed her sexual appetite.

In addition to the more prominent mistress of King Louis XV, Madame de Pompadour, of which Boucher painted many portraits, the artist also produced other portraits of he Kings mistresses. Marie-Louis OMurphy was a younger one of these mistresses to the King. This painting was commissioned when she was only fourteen years of age, and when it was presented to the King, he quickly took her as one of his courtesans. She soon became one of his favorites, and produced him an illegitimate daughter, Agathe. After only two years at court, she unwisely tried to unseat her rival, the Kings mistress Madame de Pompadour.

The picture depicts a sign on a tattered wood background. Each section of the wood has a unique colored and chipped appearance. The word Dream is prominently displayed in the center of the sign in the middle. The picture looks as if it would be at home in a bathroom or a beach setting. It gives off calm cool vibes.

Initially associated with abstract expressionism, her career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of Mountains and Sea. This painting (inspired by inspired by a trip to Nova Scotia) is large - measuring seven feet by ten feet - and has the effect of a watercolor, though it is painted in oils. In it, she introduced the technique of painting directly onto an unprepared canvas so that the material absorbs the colors. She heavily diluted the oil paint with turpentine so that the color would soak into the canvas. This technique, known as \"soak stain\" was used by Jackson Pollock (19121956), and others; and was adopted by other artists notably Morris Louis (19121962), and Kenneth Noland (19242010), and launched the second generation of the Color Field school of painting. This method would sometimes leave the canvas with a halo effect around each area to which the paint was applied but has a disadvantage in that the oil in the paints will eventually cause the canvas to discolor and rot away.

Later in her life, Kahlo was interested in ancient Eastern religions and mysticism, and The Little Deer is an assimilation of her Mexican and European heritage with these ancient beliefs. The image is of Kahlos head placed on top of a stag, which is pierced with arrows. The arrows no doubt refer to her own pain and suffering due to her injuries, as well as her injurious marriage to Diego Rivera. At the bottom of the painting, Kahlo has written carma, alluding to these ancient mystic beliefs. She also combines the eastern belief system with Aztec. An ancient Aztec symbol, the deer symbolized the right foot, and in this she was alluding to her injured right side, the foot of which had been crushed in a bus accident, and right leg being fractured in eleven different places. One year before her death, her right leg was amputated up to her right knee, due to complications from gangrene.

The Rothko Chapel is a non-denominational chapel in Houston, Texas founded by John and Dominique de Menil and opened in 1971. The interior serves not only as a chapel, but also as a major work of modern art. On its walls are fourteen black but color hued paintings by Mark Rothko. The shape of the building, an octagon inscribed in a Greek cross, and the design of the chapel was largely influenced by the artist.\n\nSusan J. Barnes states \"The Rothko Chapel...became the world's first broadly ecumenical center, a holy place open to all religions and belonging to none. It became a center for international cultural, religious, and philosophical exchanges, for colloquia and performances. And it became a place of private prayer for individuals of all faiths\".\n\nFourteen of Rothko's paintings are displayed in the chapel. Three walls display triptychs, while the other five walls display single paintings. Beginning in 1964, Rothko began painting a series of black paintings, which incorporated other dark hues and texture effects. A typical question raised by visitors viewing the massive black canvases which adorn the walls of the chapel includes some variant of: \"Where are the paintings\" The hue of the paintings vary on the lightning of the moment of the day.\n\nThe de Menils offered Rothko a commission for the chapel in 1964. From the fall of 1964 through the spring of 1967, he painted the fourteen large paintings and four alternates, which incorporated many of the characteristics of the earlier 1964 black paintings.\n\nIn front of the chapel lies Barnett Newman's sculpture Broken Obelisk.

Le Portugais marks an interesting point in the development of Braques paintings. In the top right hand corner, he stenciled the letters D BAL and under them, roman numerals. Although he had included numbers and letters into a still life in 1910, they were a representational element of the painting. In this piece, the letters and numbers are a purely compositional addition. Braques intentions at adding the letters are many, but mostly they are added to make the viewer aware of the canvas itself. In representational paintings, the canvas is there only as a surface to hold whatever image the painter desires. By adding numbers, out of context elements, and surface textures, the viewer becomes aware of the fact that the canvas can also hold outside elements, making the surface of the painting just as important as what is put on top of it.

One of a series of 28 illustrations I did for this book project for Bill Roberts' Bottle of Smoke Press.\n\nI'm not sure what this one means. But she's got a flower growing out of her head, and it doesn't get any prettier than that. For me, anyway. And I am an appreciator of beauty. You have no idea.
From the series What Does That Flower Mean. Acrylic on canvas, 18 x 12 inches, 2007. Copyright \u00A9 Rina Miriam Drescher 2007. SOLD
Looking almost like a film still, this cropped photograph demonstrates Man Ray's interest in cinematic narrative. The model's eyes and mascara-coated lashes are looking upward, invoking the viewers to wonder where she's looking and what is the source of her distress. The piece was created soon after the artist's break-up with his assistant and lover, Lee Miller. Ray created multiple works in an attempt to \"break her up\" as a revenge on a lover who left him (similar to Indestructible Object). \nThe model is in fact not a real woman but a fashion mannequin with glass bead tears on the cheeks. Here, again, Man Ray is exploring his interest in the real and unreal by challenging the meaning of still-life photography.

The Village of Hoosick Falls will always have a key place in the biography of Grandma Moses. It was here that her paintings were first discovered, sitting in Thomas' Drugstore window, and it is here that the artist is buried.\nFor Moses herself, however, the importance of Hoosick Falls lay not in its connection to her own career, but in the village's role in American history. Today Hoosick Falls, the closest real town to the Moses farmstead, is a sleepy hamlet, somewhat passed over by modern economic development. However, until the Great Depression, it was a bustling commercial center, its industrial potential bolstered by its situation at the confluence of the Hoosick and Walloomsack Rivers. Moses associated the area, hunting grounds of the Mohican Indian tribe, with the tales of James Fenimore Cooper. \"Some say Natty Bumpo sleeps his sleep in an unknown grave in the village limits,\" she wrote.\nMoses painted a number of versions of Hoosick Falls, showing the village in various seasons. Most follow the winding path of the Hoosick River, and may be based in part on old prints of the town. The bird's-eye viewencompassing more than would be visible from any single human vantage pointis, however, typical of Moses' unique approach.

Three bundled up youngsters and a big furry dog protect the homestead from the advance of the neighbors snowballs. Taking a tactically intelligent position on the roof these young warriors prepare for battle. The fresh falling snow in the foreground and bare trees in the background add a wonderful depth to this image and add to the truly realistic sight. You can almost feel the crisp winter air and taste the hot cocoa that is surely waiting on the other end of that smoking chimney.

This is a beautiful, serene painting of a lone tree. It almost appears to be after a storm, with the swirls and spots. The tree stood strong throughout the storm, even though it was alone. This is a perfect way to view our lives, like this tree: we may weather the storms alone, but we are still standing when they are over. Strength from within is also a good description of what this painting stands for.

This is a commissioned painting of a local park.   Oil on canvas 20\" x 24\"
Those who know Grandma Moses' paintings only from reproductions often fail to realize how profoundly accurate were her representations of the natural environment. Indeed, it is her precise evocations of the rural landscape that bring her paintings to life and that to a large extent account for their enduring appeal.\n\nThis aspect of Moses' achievement is perhaps most readily demonstrated by her storm scenes, for here the various forces and colors of nature appear of necessity in exaggerated form. A Storm Is on the Water Now is one of the artist's most dramatic pictures. By focusing on the terror of the two white horses, Moses has distilled and highlighted the impact of the raging torrent. A relatively limited palette further heightens the emotional effect.

Dore created many illustrations for The Idylls of the King, a set of twelve poems by the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The poems retell the story of King Arthur and his knights, the rise and fall of his kingdom, and his love for Guinevere, and her subsequent betrayal of him. Tennysons retelling of the Arthur legends was a commentary on the Victorian Era of the times in which he lived, and it was a very popular literary theme during Dores lifetime. The cycle of narrative poems were published during Dores lifetime, beginning in 1856, the last one being published in 1885, two years after his death. As such, his illustrations of the poems were one of his last works before his death.

This painting, considered Klees masterpiece, is an example of Klees masterful skill with color. Small blocks of shifting colors float through the background, set in place with a thick black outline, evincing the idea of a building or a house. It is also the finest example of Klees ability in pointillism and technical ability as an artist. As an artist with great skill with color, he was also a great teacher at color mixing and theory. He wrote his great treatise, a collection of lectures, entitled Writings on Form and Design Theory, which is considered one of the most influential writings in modern art.

This is a fun, creative picture of man's best friend. This cute and abstract group of canines is also a great picture that replicates our diversity as human beings. We may have many things in common, but we also have many differences. No two best friends are alike, as the spots and swirls and colors on these pooches demonstrates.

There are three versions of Zebra, this one is the 1937 version
A large golden horse grazes peacefully in a meadow. Her mare stands faithfully beside her being tended upon by a young girl. Blue mountains rise sharply in the background and give the landscape a clear sense of diversity. This painting has a bright natural light that would lend itself perfectly to any room. Especially that of an animal lover.
This piece features a bird sitting on the branch of a flowering tree. Done in jewel-tone colors on an antique ivory background, the artist has made the painting appear to be almost fabric-like. The print is number four in a series by Chariklia Zarris and would be a wonderful accent in a bedroom or sun room.

One of El Grecos earlier works, The Dormition of the Virgin was not attributed to him until 1983, when his signature was discovered at the bottom of the painting. This discovery led to the attribution of more of his earlier works, including Modena Triptych and Adoration of the Magi. The discovery of this piece as an El Greco painting has led to insights on his artistic style and subject matter. Painted in the Byzantine manner, this painting suggests that the artist changed his painting style in order to fit the subject matter and other requirements of the painting, including the desired location.

One of the covers for the deluxe hardcover edition of the Chance Press Ink Poems book. \n\nFacial hair is a funny thing. If you've ever spent a lot of time carefully shaving around a certain shape on your face you understand the absurd impossibility of the whole thing. Why did man descend from apes anyway Why are we cursed so Yet another thing I'll never understand.\n\nThis guy looks like a Nazi Larry David, though I don't think such a person really exists. No one really rocks the Hitler moustache anymore (and yes, I know that I misspelled moustache in the painting), he ruined it for all future generations. Not that it was a hot look to begin with, but I can imagine a bunch of hipster jerkoffs with giant eyeglasses walking around with a Pabst Blue Ribbon can in their sheeplike hands sporting a Hitler 'stash if it hadn't been for Adolph. They must cry themselves to sleep at night.

An interesting story that indicates Kandinskys intellectual examination in the creation of his works revolves around this composition. He became exhausted during the months of studying he went through in preparation for this painting, and decided to go for a walk. His assistant at the time, Gabrielle Munter, who was tidying up the studio in the artists absence, inadvertently turned the canvas on its side. Upon Kandinskys return, he saw the canvas, fell to his knees and began weeping at the beauty of the painting. His newly found perspective on the piece would change his artistic vision and direction for the rest of his life. 
Created at the same time as her to divorce to Diego Rivera, The Two Fridas is Kahlos largest painting. It is believed to be a painting depicting her deep hurt at losing her husband. One Frida sits on the left of the painting; this sis the Frida that was rejected by Rivera, Her blouse is ripped open, exposing her broken and bleeding heart. The Frida to the right, the one that Rivera still loves, has a heart that is still whole. She holds a small portrait of Rivera in her hand. After her death, this small portrait of Rivera was found amongst Kahlos belongings, and is now on display at the Museo Frida Kahlo in Mexico.

A dragon emerges from the thick black smoke circling Mount Fuji. The smoke and the dragon are one and the same, the smoke being the path through which the dragon has traveled to escape. In contrast, Mount Fuji stands pristinely white, covered in snow. Mountains in the foreground and a small puff of trees indicate the extent of the size of the mountain, which is unaffected by the escape of the dragon. Hokusai was a master at evincing an almost religious reverence for the majesty of the mountain, which stands like a fortress in the middle of the painting, allowing the dragon of smoke to escape.

The colors are so few, but speak so loud. The water colors used by Nan Rae are always so brilliant. The feel, the vibe, the everything. In the distance of this painting you can see a waterfall, and a swimming hole. I think this is the \"Distant Journey\", the relevance of the title.

Blake was interested in a wide range of cultural forms, from high art to pop music and childrens toys. Like many young Pop artists of the time he was fascinated by American popular culture, such as denim jeans and the music of Elvis, which arrived in Britain in the late 1950s.\n\nAlongside this, Blake retained a strong interest in English popular culture. His work suggests a sense of nostalgia for the paraphernalia of his childhood. Blake collected old toys and related imagery; this piece developed as both a work of art and a store for his collection of objects.

The use of basic geometric systems in the work is regarded by many as the precursor of Minimalism. The painting was made by marking equal subdivisions along the sides, bottom and top edges of the canvas and using these intervals to generate simple, symmetrical patterns comprising bands of black enamel paint separated by thin lines of unpainted canvas.\n\nFrank Stella gave the work a provocative title. Die Fahne Hoch! is named after the anthem of the Nazi Party, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, and is one of several paintings in the series that make direct reference to Nazism. By applying a hotly emotive title to the image, Stella's ironic purpose was that of destabilizing the idea of meaning itself.

now my 5th painting, and so enjoying it,hopefully be better with time.
One of Man Ray's most memorable paintings, Observatory Time, is featured in this black-and-white photograph, along with a nude. It includes a depiction of the lips of his departed lover, Lee Miller, floating in the sky above the Paris Observatory. In the photograph, the nude is lying on her side on a sofa underneath the painting, with a chessboard at her feet. Observatory Time hints at what the woman might be dreaming: a nightmare or an erotic fantasy. The lips in the picture were an inspiration for the logo of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and many other pop culture iconic images. The chessboard appears in many of the artist's works - Duchamp, Picabia and Man Ray all loved playing chess. And Man Ray considered a grid of squares, \"the basis for all art... it helps you to understand the structure, to master a sense of order.\" He also made chess set designs and photographs of chessboards, pieces and players.

The Nude Maja was the first in a two painting series, the second of which was The Clothed Maja, respectively. It is said to be the first painting in which female pubic hair is visible, making it totally profane at the time. The identity of the model in the image is under debate, with some art historians thinking the model was the mistress of Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, who commissioned the paintings, or that it was Goyas mistress. Many art historians agree that the model was a compilation of many female figures. In 1813, the Spanish Inquisition confiscated both of the paintings as obscene, returning them to the Academy of Fine Arts in 1936, after Goyas death. In the 1930s Spain issued postage stamps with the image of the Maja, and subsequently all mail bearing the stamps were denied entrance into the United States.

Calder enrolled at the Art Students League in New York and also took a job illustrating for the National Police Gazette. The magazine sent him to sketch scenes from the local circus for two weeks, and so began a lifelong interest. In 1926 he moved to Paris and created his Cirque Calder, a sort of travelling circus set made from cloth, leather, wire and found materials. The pieces represented circus performers which were designed to be manipulated manually by Calder. Soon he was presenting his Cirque Calder in both Paris and New York to much acclaim. The performance lasted two hours and in many ways predated performance art by 40 years. Cirque Calder is now part of the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum in New York, but a live performance carried out by the artist in later years can be seen on youtube.com.

Death of the Virgin was commissioned by a wealthy papal lawyer for his chapel in Trastevere, Rome, in 1601. Upon completion, it was deemed unfit for the parish, who rejected the depiction of the dead body of Mary. Other reports say the painting was unfit for the parish because of Marys bare legs. It was also a controversial piece because Caravaggio is said to have used a prostitute, one of his most common models, as the model for the Virgin Mary. Either way, it was later bought by the Duke of Mantua, after hearing from Peter Paul Rubens that it was one of Caravaggios best works

Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. \"Looking at the stars always makes me dream,\" he said, \"Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.\"\nThe artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: \"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting.

A little boy and his dog tread through the deep fresh snow of a cold country winter. Neither, however, seem at all concerned by their new audience of cows. The impending hill and heart racing speeds that await them are of far more concern. This image is truly nostalgic for any viewer with childhood memories of snowy winters. The dark colors of the cows and the boys jacket stand out in stark contrast to the bleak snowy sky in the background. Surely hanging above a family room fire place this image would be quite at home.

The Thunderstorm poignantly illustrates how Grandma Moses managed to combine intensely evocative renditions of natural phenomena with dramatic anecdotal detail.\n\nThere are several levels of action in The Thunderstorm. Fierce storm clouds arc rapidly approaching over the mountains, and in the distance the trees have already begun to whip wildly in the wind. The artist's deployment of color to represent these events is extraordinarily acute: The parched yellows of a late summer meadow, the varied greens of the trees, and the shifting colors of the sky before the advancing torrent are all keenly observed.\n\nIn the foreground, Moses presents the human reaction to the oncoming threat. There is a mad rush to get the hay into the barn and, at middle distance, a black horse bolts in terror.\n\nThe girl in the yellow dress is frozen in mid-run, while strangely, behind her to the left, two other children seem oblivious to the commotion. The abstract forms used to render all the human and animal activity stand in sharp contrast to the impressionistic interplay of colors in the landscape elements of the composition. This juxtaposition of abstraction and realism was one of the principal cornerstones of the \"Grandma Moses style.\"

Inspired by the beauty and majesty of nature, Canadian artist Brent Heighton left behind a successful career in commercial art to concentrate on work that touched a deeper part of his heart. Painted in dreamy, muted tones of blues and greens, his watercolor \"Keeper of the Pond\" (part of his Pond Impressions Series), features the elegant form of a heron wading through a tranquil pond, against a backdrop of impressionistic, almost abstract, reeds.

The artist of this print, a Mr. Jim Williams, shows a great skill for finding the prefect balance of contrast and simplicity. The bright colors of the dogs stand out in great opposition to the black background. The added color of each individual collar creates even more depth in this piece and creates the idea of detail when in reality very little is used. The unmistakable image of the Labrador is sure to appeal to dog lovers and owners alike. Because after all nothing says welcome home quite like being greeted by a dog - or five.

Also entitled The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World, this painting contains a literal illustration of idioms and aphorisms of 16th century Flemish life. Whereas some of the idioms have been lost to history, others are still relevant and in use today. Although other artists and authors had produced paintings and books on proverbs, this painting is considered to be the first large-scale rendition of the theme. The proverbs, of which there are over 100, as well as the early titles, are meant to illustrate human stupidity and foolishness. The painting was so popular that Pieter Brueghel the Younger reproduced up to twenty copies of it, many of which included various renditions on the proverbs.

One of the most famous paintings in Russian art, Black Square marked the turning point of the Russian avant-garde movement. Before creating this painting, Malevich spent eighteen months in his studio, laboring over thirty non-objective paintings. In the end, he had created a series of non-objective paintings, of which Black Square is one. His invention of the word suprematism was meant to refer to the supremacy of the new geometric forms. Although the other works in this period were created with visual brushstrokes and asymmetrical forms, Black Square was the prominent piece, with no visual textures and a perfectly symmetrical shape, as it was the paramount of Malevichs change to pure geometric abstraction: suprematism.

In the guise of women dressed in contemporary clothing, Maurice Denis updates a subject taken from classical mythology  the muses who inspire the arts and sciences. But he transforms the theme profoundly, stripping the muses of the traditional attributes which allow them to be identified.\n\nIn the group of three women sitting in the foreground we can see the figure of Marthe, whom the painter married in June 1893 and who inspired his art until her death. In a device common in Denis' work, she is shown twice: in profile in red and from the back, sitting on the chair. Maurice Denis has set the scene on the terrace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the town where he lived all his life. The century-old chestnut trees give the composition rhythm and decorative power. The regular strokes of the tree trunks are a pretext for a play of vertical lines which contrast with the curves and ornamental arabesques of the branches, the leaves strewn on the ground, and the patterns and folds of the dresses. The graphic play of lines and interlacing is intensified by the unreal, autumnal colours, painted in areas of flat colour and neatly outlined. The flattened space is that of a \"sacred wood\", the setting for a revelation and the figures' mysterious communication with nature and supernatural powers. An enigmatic tenth muse in the background (while traditionally there are only nine), with one arm raised to the light of the sky, convinces us of that.

Although it was published in the 17th century, Cervantes novel Don Quixote was still very popular during the time Gustave Dore was chosen to illustrate the book in the 1860s. His depiction of the farcical Quixote and the short and paunchy Sancho Panza became so famous that they influenced entire generations of readers. The images he created depicting Quixote, Panza, and the other characters through their episodes became so popular that they became the standard for the way in which people viewed the characters in the book. Further stage and film publications, as well as public image, were all based on Dores depiction of Quixotes physical appearance.

The focus of this painting is a yellow and blue bird amidst the branches of a flowering tree. The artist uses blue, yellow, green and pink/red tones against a background of antique ivory. The piece has an oriental flair to it and looks almost like a piece of fabric. This is number one of a four-piece collection by artist Chariklia Zarris.

Van Gogh painted Irises the year before his death, in 1889, during his stay at the asylum in Saint Remy de Provence. Van Gogh often used painting as a way to keep himself from going insane, and this painting was one such work. It was painted before his first mental attack at the asylum. Van Gogh sent the painting to his brother Theo, who immediately sent it to the Salon des Independants that same year, where it was exhibited and highly praised. It continued to set high price records at auction until it was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 1990.

This fresco beautifully exemplifies Giottos break with Byzantine techniques. He creates a highly emotional story with the combination of elements of traditional Byzantine paintings, such as the dimensional layout and iconography, with his stylized faces showing an emotional response to the death of Christ. The result pulls the viewer into the scene by inviting them to witness the pain and anguish of the Lamentation. You can almost hear the sobs of the women and the shrieks from the angels above. This realistic depiction of emotion on human faces set him apart from other artists of his day, turning Christ and his followers into real human beings with real emotion.

By 1874 Manet came under the sway of Monet's approach to painting quickly, out of doors. In the summer of that year, Manet stayed at his family's house in Gennevilliers, just across the Seine from Monet in Argenteuil. The Monet family was living in a house that Manet had helped them find the year before. This portrait of the Monet familyCamille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the leftis one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. While Manet painted the Monet family, Renoir painted beside him and Monet worked nearby. Monet painted Manet at his easel (present location unknown), while Renoir, like Manet, painted Madame Monet, Jean Monet, and the rooster (http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874). In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: \"Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'\"

You may notice that they come up twice in these Karaoke paintings, and I didn't even realize that until just now.

\n  Maest\u00E0,\u00A0( Italian: Majesty)\u00A0double-sided altarpieces executed for the cathedral of Siena by the Italian painter Duccio. The first version (1302), originally in the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, is now lost. The second version (130811), painted for the cathedral of Siena and one of the largest altarpieces of its time, consisted of a wide central panel with the Virgin and Child adored by the patrons of Siena and surrounded by saints and angels. Beneath was a predella with seven scenes from the childhood of Christ; above were pinnacles with scenes from the life of the Virgin; and on the back were scenes from the life of Christ. The main panel and the bulk of the narrative scenes are now in the Museo dellOpera Metropolitana, Piazza del Duomo, Siena, but isolated panels from the altarpiece have found their way to the National Gallery, London; the Frick Collection, New York City; and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Bernini carves a bust for English King Charles I from a painting by Van Dyke. It was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII as a gift to the Queen Henrietta Maria in hopes that Charles would reconnect with the Catholic Church. The sculpture was greatly admired by the King. Unfortunately it was lost in the fire in the Whitehall Palace in 1698. This is a photo of it's copy.

By far the most recognizable of Millets works, The Gleaners depicts a trio of women gleaning the last bits of wheat from a field. Millet found the theme of women gleaning the last bits of wheat an eternal one, linked to stories of the Old Testament. The painting was received by the public with open scorn. It presented what at the time were the lowest ranks of society, taking advantage of the age-old right to remove the last bits of grain left over from wheat harvest, in a sympathetic light. During his lifetime, this painting garnered naught but notoriety from a French upper-class that feared glorifying the lower ranks of society, and it was not until after the artists death that it became more popular.

\"Yellow Roses still alive January 2012 - Happy New Year\"\nOriginal Tempera Painting on Canvas painted 2011 december last days - Yellow Roses still alive in The Garden of Eden - size 30cmx23,5cm
The rectangles within this painting do not extend to the edges of the canvas and appear to hover just over its surface. Heightening this sensation is the effect of chromatic afterimage. Staring at each colored segment individually affects the perception of those adjacent to it. The redorange center of the painting tints the yellow above it with just a bit of green. The yellow above seems to tint the orange with blue. Despite these color relationships, Rothko did not want his pictures appreciated solely for their spectral qualities. He said, \"If you are only moved by color relationships, then you miss the point. I'm interested in expressing the big emotionstragedy, ecstasy, doom.\"

Considered Mondrians masterpiece, Broadway Boogie Woogie is a shimmering combination of multi-colored grid lines, complete with blocks of color, all in the primary palette. This piece represents another development in the unique style of the artist, which may have been the most profound. After the abandonment of representational forms in 1913 and the reconciliation of his spiritual concerns with his aesthetic, Mondrian had finally developed the transition of solid black lines to lines consisting of multi-colored, vibrant hues, creating an entirely new feeling. This painting represents Mondrians seminal work as an artist, and unlike much of his work, is not entirely non-representational. One can see the grid of the Manhattan city streets and feel the beat of the boogie woogie music of which Mondrian was so fond.

Edward Hopper said that Nighthawks was inspired by \"a restaurant on New York's Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet,\" but the image, with its carefully constructed composition and lack of narrative, has a timeless quality that transcends its particular locale. One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture.

This is a pen and ink creation of two women approaching the same point on the steps.  Both are well dressed but one is a black maid to a wealthy family and the other is a wealthy lady and therein lies the dilemma.

Soliloquy I is beautiful. The muted color palette gives of a calming effect, while the brush strokes imply movement. The treatment around the outside as well as the slight abstraction make it seem like a sort of vignette, possibly invoking nostalgic feelings. The composition is very well done. Overall this piece is interesting, well-executed and has a quiet beauty about it.

The Persistence of Memory is by far Salvador Dalis most recognizable painting, and there are many references to it in popular culture. Although it was conjectured that the soft melting watches were the result of Dalis interpretation of the theory of relativity, Dali himself state that their inspiration was camembert cheese melting under the sun. The sequence of melting clocks in a disjointed landscape is the depiction of a dream that Dali had experienced, the figure in the middle of the painting being the face of the dreamer himself. The general interpretation is that the painting, which portrays many melting watches, is a rejection of time as a solid and deterministic influence.\nThis iconic and much-reproduced painting depicts time as a series of melting watches surrounded by swarming ants that hint at decay, an organic process in which Dali held an unshakeable fascination. Elaborated in the frontispiece to the Second Surrealist Manifesto, the seminal distinction between hard and soft objects, associated by Dali with order and putrefaction respectively, informs his working method in subverting inherent textual properties: the softening of hard objects and corresponding hardening of soft objects. It is likely that Dali was using the clocks to symbolize mortality (specifically his own) rather than literal time, as the melting flesh in the painting's center is loosely based on Dali's profile. The cliffs that provide the backdrop are taken from images of Catalonia, Dali's home.\n

One of the artists most famous performances, Beuys covered his head first with honey, and then with fifty dollars worth of gold leaf. He cradles a dead hare in his arms, and strapped an iron plate to the bottom of his right shoe. Viewed from behind glass in the gallery, the audience could see Beuys walking from drawing to drawing, quietly whispering in the dead rabbits ear. As he walked around the room, the silence was pierced by intermittent sound of his footsteps; the loud crack of the iron on the floor, and the soundless whisper of the sole of shoe.
Acrylic on Masonite board.  45 x 30 cm\nDuring my time of Family Daycare for the local Council, the children I cared for decorated our teddy for a flower show.  After he had been exhibited, I wanted so much to remember him like that, that I painted him.  Our theme included the teddy sitting in the snow.  He was very popular at the flower show and I was very proud of the children who designed the theme.  He now lives with a neighbour's boy who has down syndrome (one of my childcare group).\nThis picture was entered into a local competition, and hung.  This was my second exhibited picture.  So he's special.

In Henry Ford Hospital, Kahlo deals directly with her own mortality and her inability to have children. Kahlo dealt directly with death her entire life. At the age of three the Mexican Revolution started, bringing here up in a world fraught with gunfights and banditos. At six years old, she was struck down by polio, which left one leg thinner than the other. She also witnessed many street fights between Mexican revolutionaries while studying in college. Finally, when she was 18, she was involved in a tragic bus accident, which left many people dead. Kahlo was injured so seriously that she suffered severe pain for the rest of her life, and she was never able to have a child with her husband, Diego Rivera.
