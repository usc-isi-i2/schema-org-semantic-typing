\n                            The Ghent-Terneuzen Canal\u00A0 also known as the \"Sea Canal\" (Zeekanaal) is a canal linking Ghent in Belgium to the port of Terneuzen on the Westerschelde (Scheldt) estuary in the Netherlands, thereby providing the former with better access to the sea.\n\nThe canal was constructed between 1823 and 1827 on the initiative of the Dutch King: Belgium (as it subsequently became) and the Netherlands had become a united country under the terms agreed at the Congress of Vienna. After Belgium broke away in 1830, traffic to and from Belgium was blocked by the Dutch until 1841.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1885 the canal was enlarged to a depth of six and a half meters at its centre, and to a width of 17 meters at its base and 68 meters at the surface level: bridges were rebuilt accordingly along the Belgian sector.\n\nThe famous Cluysen - Ter Donck Regatta was organised here for many decades (1888-1954) and during the 1913 Expo of Ghent the European Rowing Championships took place on the canal.

\n  Great Man-Made River\u00A0(GMR),\u00A0a network of underground pipelines bringing high-quality fresh water from ancient underground aquifers deep in the Sahara to the coast of Libya for domestic use, agriculture, and industry. The GMR was originally conceived as having several arms, or phases, though not all have been built and some may never be. Nevertheless, since 1991 the project has supplied much-needed irrigation and drinking water to populous cities and farming areas in Libyas north, which previously were dependent on desalination plants and on declining rain-fed aquifers near the coast.

\n                            \n                  \n                    The Canal du Midi (Occitan: Canal de las Doas Mars, meaning canal of the two seas) is a 240 km (150 mi) long canal in Southern France (French: le Midi). The canal connects the Garonne River to the \u00C9tang de Thau on the Mediterranean and along with the 193 km long Canal de Garonne forms the Canal des Deux Mers joining the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. The canal runs from the city of Toulouse down to the \u00C9tang de Thau. The Canal du Midi was built by Pierre-Paul Riquet. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\n\nHistory\nThe Canal du Midi was built to serve as a shortcut between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, avoiding the long sea voyage around hostile Spain, Barbary pirates, and a trip that in the 17th century took a full month to complete. Its strategic value was obvious and it had been discussed for centuries, in particular when King Francis I brought Leonardo da Vinci to France in 1516 and commissioned a survey of a route from the Garonne at Toulouse to the Aude at Carcassonne. The major problem was how to supply the summit sections with enough water.\n\nThe canal was built on a grand scale, with oval shaped locks 30.5 m (100 ft) long, 6 m (20 ft) wide at the gates and 11 m (36 ft) wide in the middle. This design was intended to resist the collapse of the walls that happened early in the project. The oval locks used the strength of the arch against the inward pressure of the surrounding soil that had destabilized the early locks with straight walls. Such arches had been used by the Romans for retaining walls in Gaul, so this technique was not new, but its application to locks was revolutionary and was imitated in early American canals.\n\nMany of the structures were designed with neoclassical elements to further and to echo the king's ambitions to make France a New Rome. The Canal du Midi as a grand piece of infrastructural engineering in itself was promoted as worthy of Rome and the political dreams behind it were clarified with plaques in Latin, and walls built with Roman features. The Canal du Midi was opened officially as the Canal Royal de Languedoc on May 15, 1681. It was also referred to as the Canal des Deux Mers (Canal of Two Seas).\n\nIt eventually cost over 15 million livres, of which nearly two million came from Riquet himself, leaving him with huge debts, and he died in 1680, just months before the Canal was opened. His sons inherited the canal, but the family's investments were not recovered and debts not fully paid until over 100 years later. The canal was well managed and run as a paternalistic enterprise until the revolution.\n\nCharacteristics Of The Canal\nThe 240 km long Canal has 91 locks which serve to ascend and descend a total of 190 metres (620 ft). It has 328 structures, including bridges, dams and a tunnel. There are now over 40 aqueducts, but when created by Riquet, there were only three, the R\u00E9pudre Aqueduct, Aiguille Aqueduct and Jouarres Aqueduct. To cross the other streams, the streams were dammed below the canal and the boats crossed on the rivers themselves. From 1683 to 1693, Vauban improved the canal adding drainage ditches and over 40 aqueducts. Among the most important were the Orbiel Aqueduct and Cesse Aqueducts. The Orb Aqueduct was finished in 1858 and finally, the Herbettes Aqueduct in 1983.\n\nNow the Canal has become a tourist attraction and place for leisure activities, with many people rowing, canoeing, fishing or even cruising on luxury hotel barges such as the Anjodi. The canal's beauty is enhanced by rows of stately Plane trees that line each side. The 42,000 trees, which date from the 1830s, were planted to stabilize the banks. In 2006 a wilt infection was discovered that is killing the trees. About 2,500 had been destroyed by mid-2011, at which time it was projected that all would need to be destroyed and replaced in 20 years.                  \n                \n                    
\n  Corinth Canal,\u00A0tidal waterway across the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece, joining the Gulf of Corinth in the northwest with the Saronic Gulf in the southeast. The isthmus was first crossed by boats in 600 bc when Periander built a ship railway, small boats being carried on wheeled cradles running in grooves. This system may have been used until the 9th century. Work on the canal began in 1882, and it opened in 1893. The canal is 6.3 km (3.9 miles) long and has a water depth of 8 metres (26 feet); its width varies from a minimum of 21 metres (69 feet) at the bottom to a maximum of 25 metres (82 feet) at the waters surface. The canal has brought great economic benefits to the ports of Posithon\u00EDa at its northwest end and Isthm\u00EDa at its southeast end.

\n  Caledonian Canal,\u00A0waterway running southwest to northeast across the Glen Mor fault of northern Scotland and connecting the North Sea with the North Atlantic Ocean. In 1773 James Watt was employed by the British government to make a survey for such a canal, which would link together a chain of freshwater lakes including Lochs Ness, Oich, and Lochy. Construction was begun in 1803 under the direction of Thomas Telford, and the canal was opened for navigation in 1822, although it was not completed until 1847. From the northeastern entrance on Moray Firth to the southwestern entrance at Loch Linnhe, the canals total length is about 60 miles (100 km), that of the artificial channels being about 23 miles (37 km). Formerly of great economic importance, the canal is now used only by fishing and pleasure craft because it is too small to accommodate modern oceangoing vessels.
Bian Canal,\u00A0Chinese (Pinyin) Bian He or Bian Shui or (Wade-Giles romanization) Pien Ho or Pien Shui,\u00A0\n    historic canal running northwest-southeast through Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces of eastern China. The name was given to several different canals that connected the Huang He (Yellow River), north of Zhengzhou in Henan, with the Huai River and then, via the Shanyang Canal, with the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) at Yangzhou, in Jiangsu. The terrain in the region is so flat and the drainage system so impermanent that no major engineering works were involved, apart from the manpower needed to excavate new channels. The canals made considerable use of existing waterways, which were widened, linked, and canalized.
\n                            \n                  \n                    The Grand Canal is a canal in Venice, Italy. It forms one of the major water-traffic corridors in the city. Public transport is provided by water buses and private water taxis, and many tourists explore the canal by gondola. At one end the canal leads into the lagoon near Santa Lucia railway station and the other end leads into Saint Mark Basin: in between it makes a large S-shape through the central districts (sestieri) of Venice. It is 3,800 m long, 30\u201390 m wide, with an average depth of five meters (16.5 ft).\n\nThe banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date to 13th to the 18th century and demonstrate the welfare and art created by the Republic of Venice. The noble Venetian families faced huge expenses to show off their richness in suitable palazzos: this contest reveals the citizens\u2019 pride and the deep bond with the lagoon. Amongst the many are the Palazzi Barbaro, Ca' Rezzonico, Ca' d'Oro, Palazzo Dario, Ca' Foscari, Palazzo Barbarigo and to Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, housing the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The churches along the canal include the basilica of Santa Maria della Salute. Centuries-old traditions such as the Historical Regatta are perpetuated every year along the Canal.\n\nEvents:\nHistorical Regatta:\nOn the First Sunday of September takes place the Historical Regatta (\"Regata Storica\"), a competition between Venetian boats watched by thousands of people from the banks or from floating stands. Competitions are preceded by a historical procession (\"Corteo Storico\") remembering the entrance of the Queen of Cyprus Catherine Cornaro after abdication in 1489: gondoliers in costumes sail in typical 16th century boats following the Bucentaur, Doge's state galley.\n\nThe Feast-day of the Madonna della Salute:\nOn November 21, Venetians thank the Virgin Mary for saving from the plague epidemic in 1630-38 with a pilgrimage to Santa Maria della Salute. Pilgrims cross Grand Canal on a temporary pontoon bridge from Campo Santa Maria Zobenigo, and enjoy stalls and traditional dishes.                  \n                \n

\n  Kiel Canal,\u00A0German Nord-Ostsee-Kanal, English North SeaBaltic Sea Canal,\u00A0 waterway in northern Germany, extending eastward for 98 km (61 miles) from Brunsb\u00FCttelkoog (on the North Sea, at the mouth of the Elbe River) to Holtenau (at Kiel Harbour on the Baltic Sea). The canal has been enlarged twice and is today 160 metres (526 feet) wide and 11 metres (37 feet) deep and is spanned by seven high-level bridges that have about 43 metres (140 feet) of clearance for ships beneath them. The locks are 45 metres (146 feet) wide by 327 metres (1,072 feet) long. The canal constitutes the safest, most convenient, shortest, and cheapest shipping route between the two seas.
Panama Canal,\u00A0Spanish Canal de Panam ,\u00A0\n    lock-type canal, owned and administered by the Republic of Panama, that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow Isthmus of Panama. The length of the Panama Canal from shoreline to shoreline is about 65 km (40 miles) and from deep water in the Atlantic (more specifically, the Caribbean Sea) to deep water in the Pacific about 82 km (50 miles). The canal is one of the two most strategic artificial waterways in the world, the other being the Suez Canal. Ships sailing between the east and west coasts of the United States, which otherwise would be obliged to round Cape Horn in South America, shorten their voyage by about 15,000 km (8,000 nautical miles) by using the canal. Savings of up to 6,500 km (3,500 nautical miles) also are made on voyages between one coast of North America and ports on the other side of South America. Ships sailing between Europe and East Asia or Australia can save as much as 3,700 km (2,000 nautical miles) by using the canal.

\n            The Aqueduct of Vanvitelli or Caroline Aqueduct is an aqueduct built to supply the Reggia di Caserta and the San Leucio complex, supplied by water arising at the foot of Taburno, from the springs of the Fizzo, in the territory of Bucciano (BN), which it carries along a winding 38 km route (mostly underground). Commissioned by Charles of Bourbon and designed by Luigi Vanvitelli (after whom it derives its two names), its construction began in March 1753 and concluded with its opening on 7 May 1762.\n\nOf particular architectural value is the perfectly preserved 529-metre-long (1,736 ft) section in tufa bridging the Valle di Maddaloni between Monte Logano (to the east) and Monte Garzano (to the west) - this section was made a World Heritage Site in 1997 and (modelled on ancient Roman aqueducts) is made of three rows of arches, 55.8 metres (183 ft) high at its highest point.          
\n  Cape Cod Canal,\u00A0artificial waterway in southeastern Massachusetts, U.S. A part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, it joins Cape Cod Bay (northeast) with the waters of Buzzards Bay (southwest) and traverses the narrow isthmus of Cape Cod. The canal is 17.5 miles (28 km) long, including its dredged approaches. It has a width of 500 feet (152 metres) and a minimum depth of 30 feet (9 metres). There are no locks, but there are considerable tidal movements.
\n  Trent Canal,\u00A0also called TrentSevern Waterway,\u00A0 canal, southeastern Ontario, Canada, linking Georgian Bay of Lake Huron with Lake Ontario. It extends from the southeastern shore of Georgian Bay near Port Severn, up the Severn River to Lake Simcoe, eastward, connecting several lakes of the Kawartha Lake region to Rice Lake, and down the Trent River to the Bay of Quinte (at Trenton) and Lake Ontario; the small Murray Canal, 8 miles (12 km) long, connects Trenton more directly with Lake Ontario. Trent Canals 240-mile (386-km) main course consists of 33 miles (53 km) of man-made channels (6 to 8 feet [1.8 to 2.4 metres] deep), marine railways at Big Chute on the Severn River, and 42 locks. Among the latter are two hydraulic-lift locks, the one at Peterborough being one of the worlds highest (65 feet [20 metres]). The Trent Canal also has branches of 10 and 35 miles (16 and 56 km; the latter with one lock). Started in 1833, the waterway once served a flourishing lumber trade. Because of improved road and rail networks, however, its significance as a commercial water route declined rapidly after 1930. The waterway is now a popular tourist attraction providing access to recreational areas, and it is used for municipal water supplies, flood control, and hydroelectricity. Orillia, Barrie, Lindsay, Peterborough, and Trenton are the largest communities along the waterway.

Suez Canal,\u00A0Arabic Qant al-Suways,\u00A0\n    sea-level waterway running north-south across the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt to connect the Mediterranean and the Red seas. The canal separates the African continent from Asia, and it provides the shortest maritime route between Europe and the lands lying around the Indian and western Pacific oceans. It is one of the worlds most heavily used shipping lanes. The canal extends 101 miles (163 kilometres) between Port Said (Br Sad) in the north and Suez in the south, with dredged approach channels north of Port Said into the Mediterranean, and south of Suez. The canal does not take the shortest route across the isthmus, which is only 75 miles, but utilizes several lakes, from north to south, Lake Manzala (Buayrat al-Manzilah), Lake Timsah (Buayrat al-Tims), and the Bitter Lakes: Great Bitter Lake (Al-Buayrah al-Murrah al-Kubr) and Little Bitter Lake (Al-Buayrah al-Murrah al-ughr). The Suez Canal is an open cut, without locks, and, though extensive straight lengths occur, there are eight major bends. To the west of the canal is the low-lying delta of the Nile River; to the east is the higher, rugged, and arid Sinai Peninsula. Prior to construction of the canal ... (200 of 2,936 words)

The canal extends 101 miles (163 kilometres) between Port Said (Br Sad) in the north and Suez in the south, with dredged approach channels north of Port Said into the Mediterranean, and south of Suez. The canal does not take the shortest route across the isthmus, which is only 75 miles, but utilizes several lakes, from north to south, Lake Manzala (Buayrat al-Manzilah), Lake Timsah (Buayrat al-Tims), and the Bitter Lakes: Great Bitter Lake (Al-Buayrah al-Murrah al-Kubr) and Little Bitter Lake (Al-Buayrah al-Murrah al-ughr). The Suez Canal is an open cut, without locks, and, though extensive straight lengths occur, there are eight major bends. To the west of the canal is the low-lying delta of the Nile River; to the east is the higher, rugged, and arid Sinai Peninsula. Prior to construction of the canal ... (200 of 2,936 words)

\n  Main-Danube Canal,\u00A0also called Europa Canal, German Main-Donau-Kanal or Europa-Kanal,\u00A0 commercial waterway in the southern German state of Bavaria. Completed in 1992, the canal is 171 km (106 miles) long and runs from Bamberg on the Main River (a tributary of the Rhine River) to Kelheim on the Danube River, permitting traffic to flow between the North Sea and the Black Sea. It thus creates a 3,500-km (2,200-mile) waterway that runs through 15 countries and can accommodate barges carrying up to 2,425 tons of bulk cargo. The canal, one of the largest civil engineering projects ever undertaken, has a total of 16 locks, each about 190 metres (625 feet) long, 12 metres (40 feet) wide, and up to 30 metres (100 feet) deep. It reaches a height of more than 406 metres (1,332 feet) over the Swabian Alps, south of N\u00FCrnberg.

\n  Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,\u00A0 former waterway, extending 184.5 miles (297 km) along the east bank of the Potomac River between Washington, D.C., and Cumberland in western Maryland. Begun in 1828, the canal was intended to provide cheap transportation between the Atlantic seaports and the Midwest via the Potomac River. It immediately faced competition from the Erie Canal, however, and further construction was abandoned in 1850 after the canal had reached Cumberland. From the 1840s the canal also faced stiff competition from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was able to buy the waterway in 1894. The canal was purchased in 1938 by the U.S. government and was restored as a unit of the national parks system; it became a national historical park in 1971.

It starts from the Harike Barrage at Sultanpur, a few kilometers below the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab state.  Irrigation facilities to the north-western region of Rajasthan, a part of the Thar Desert. \n\nIt consists of the Rajasthan feeder canal (with the first 167 km in Punjab and Haryana and the remaining 37 km in Rajasthan) and 445 km of the Rajasthan main canal which is entirely within Rajasthan. The IGNP traverses seven districts of Rajasthan: Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, and Sriganganagar.\n\nSand dune stabilization  \n\nThe Indira Gandhi Canal is a major step in reclaiming the Thar Desert and checking desertification of fertile areas. There is a planting programme for greening the desert in areas near the Indira Gandhi Canal which was started in 1965. This consists of the planting of shelter belts along roads and canals, blocks of plantations and sand dune stabilization. The tree species being used for planting are Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus terticornis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Morus alba, Tecomella undulata, Acacia tortilis, Azadirachta indica, Albizia lebbeck, Cassia fistula, Popular ciliata, Melia azedarch, and Acacia nilotica.\u00A0                  \n                \n                    
\n                            The Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal, also named the Willebroek Canal, is a canal in Belgium linking Brussels with the river Scheldt. The canal was known as the Brussels-Rupel Maritime Canal, prior to the establishment of a direct link with the Scheldt in 1997.\n\nThe canal is one of the oldest navigable canals in Belgium and indeed in Europe. Construction work began in 1550 and lasted until 1561.\n\nHowever, permission to build the canal had already been granted by Philip the Good in 1436. But due to protests from the city of Mechelen, authorized to levy taxes on all transport via the Senne, the project was stalled for a very long time.\n\nIn 1531 the Emperor, Charles V renewed the authorization of Philip the Good, but work did not begin immediately. It was not until 1550 that Mary of Hungary made an agreement to begin construction. On 16 June 1550 the mayor of Brussels, Jean de Locquenghien gave the ground-breaking ceremony.                    
\n  Moscow Canal,\u00A0Russian Kanal Moskva,\u00A0 ship waterway linking Moscow to the Volga River at Ivankovo, north of Moscow. Built between 1932 and 1937, the canal replaced the canalized Moskva River, which can take only small craft, as the main water access to Moscow. The water journey to the important industrial centre of Nizhny Novgorod (formerly Gorky) was shortened by 75 miles (120 km). Along the Moscow Canals length of 80 miles (128 km) there are 11 locks. The minimum depth is 18 feet (5.5 m), and lock dimensions are 950 by 100 feet (290 by 30 m).

It cuts through the narrow Isthmus of Corinth and separates the Peloponnesian peninsula from the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is 6.4 kilometres (4.0\u00A0mi) in length and only 21.3 metres (70\u00A0ft) wide at its base, making it unpassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.\n\nThe canal was mooted in classical times and an abortive effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD. Construction finally got underway in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.                  \n                \n                    
\n            \n        \n          The Albert Canal\u00A0 is a canal located in northeastern Belgium, named after King Albert I of Belgium. It connects the major cities Antwerp and Li\u00E8ge and the Meuse and Scheldt rivers. It has a depth of 3.4 metres (11\u00A0ft), a free height of 6.7 metres (22\u00A0ft) and a total length of 129.5 kilometres (80.5\u00A0mi). The maximum capacity is a barge of 10,000 tons.\n\nBetween Antwerp and Li\u00E8ge, there is a height difference of 56 metres (184\u00A0ft), and a total of 6 canal locks were needed to overcome the difference in elevation. Five canal locks each have a height difference of 10 metres (33\u00A0ft), located in Genk, Diepenbeek, Hasselt, Kwaadmechelen and Olen, while the canal lock at Wijnegem has a height difference of 5.45 metres (17.9\u00A0ft).\n\nIn the 1930s, it took about 7 days to travel from Antwerp to Liege over water. These days the same distance is covered in 18 hours. Since the completion of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992, a barge can now travel from Antwerp all the way across Europe to the Black Sea.\n\nThe Albert Canal was dug from 1930-1939. The German construction firm Hochtief AG worked on the canal between 1930 and 1934. It was used for the first time in 1940, but because of World War II, serious use only began in 1946.        \n      \n

To relieve this areas chronic shortage of water, the canal was constructed for 44 miles (71 km) across the mountains to a large dam on the Zhang River in Shanxi. Construction of the canal was an engineering feat: in places it required cutting the channel into sheer cliff faces and constructing 42 tunnels and many aqueducts, some of considerable length. Since 1965, when the main canal was completed, the area has been linked with a system of drainage channels and reservoirs and with more than 600 miles (965 km) of irrigation canals. The system irrigates some 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares). It supports 14 hydroelectric stations that supply power to local coal-fueled industries, producing cement, fertilizer, iron, and steel for local consumption.

Taking advantage of the Mohawk River gap in the Appalachian Mountains, the Erie Canal, 584 km (363 miles) long, was the first canal in the United States to connect western waterways with the Atlantic Ocean. Construction began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. Its success propelled New York City into a major commercial centre and encouraged canal construction throughout the United States. In addition, construction of the canal served as a training ground for many of the engineers who built other American canals and railroads in the ensuing decades.

The three main canals, Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht, dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area, including the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, are put on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nNotable Canals in the Canal Belt\nInward to outward, the canals are as follows:\nSingel\nSingel encircled the medieval city of Amsterdam. It served as a moat around the city from 1480 until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond Singel. The canal runs from the IJ bay, near Central Station, to the Muntplein square, where it meets the Amstel river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals. The canal should not be confused with Singelgracht canal, which became the outer limit of the city during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th Century.\n\nHerengracht\nHerengracht (Patricians' Canal or Lord's Canal) is the first of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam. The canal is named after the heren regeerders who governed the city in the 16th and 17th century. The most fashionable part is called the Golden Bend, with many double wide mansions, inner gardens and coach houses on Keizersgracht.\n\nKeizersgracht\nKeizersgracht is the second and widest of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam, in between Herengracht and Prinsengracht. It is named after Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nPrinsengracht\nPrinsengracht (Prince's Canal) is the fourth and the longest of the main canals in Amsterdam. It is named after the Prince of Orange. Most of the canal houses along it were built during the Dutch Golden Age of the United Provinces. The bridges over this canal don't connect with the streets in the Jordaan. Notable buildings along Prinsengracht include the Noorderkerk (Northern Church), the Noordermarkt (Northern Market), Anne Frank House, the Westerkerk (Western Church, Amsterdam's tallest church) with the Homomonument (Gay Monument), which actually faces Keizersgracht.\n\nOther Notable Canals\nZwanenburgwal\nZwanenburgwal is a canal and street in the center of Amsterdam. The painter Rembrandt and philosopher Spinoza lived here. In 2006 it was voted one of the most beautiful streets in Amsterdam by readers of Het Parool, a local daily newspaper. It flows from Sint Antoniessluis sluice gate (between the streets Sint Antoniesbreestraat and Jodenbreestraat) to the Amstel river. The canal was originally named Verversgracht (\"dyers' canal\"), after the textile industry that once dominated this part of town. Dyed textiles were hung to dry along the canal.\n\nBrouwersgracht\nBrouwersgracht is a canal in the city centre of Amsterdam and is part of the canal belt connecting the Singel, Herengracht, Keizergracht and Prinsengracht and marks the northern border of the canal belt. The canal served as a site for ships returning from Asia with spices and silks, therefore Brouwersgracht had many warehouses and storage depots for the ships inventories. Breweries were also prevalent in the area due to the access to fresh water shipments. Today the warehouses are now apartments, some of the most expensive in Amsterdam. Houseboats also are seen in the canal. In 2007, Brouwersgracht was voted the most beautiful street in Amsterdam by readers of Het Parool, a local daily newspaper.\n\nBrantasgracht, Lamonggracht, Majanggracht and Seranggracht\nThese four canals are the newest in Amsterdam, constructed on Java Island in 1995, a manmade island in the IJ Harbor, north-east of the City Center. The canals are lined with modern interpretations of classic Amsterdam canal houses, which were designed by 19 young Dutch architects. Each house is 4.5 meters wide and 4 or 5 stories tall, but the designs are totally unique and are often featured in Amsterdam travel guides despite being off the beaten path of most tourists. Nine ornate metal bridges, designed by artist couple Guy Rombouts and Monika Droste, cross the canals for pedestrians and cyclists.                  \n                \n                    
\n                            \n                  \n                    Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands, has been called the \"Venice of the North\" for its more than one hundred kilometres of canals, about 90 islands and 1,500 bridges. The three main canals, Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht, dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area, including the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, are put on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nNotable Canals in the Canal Belt\nInward to outward, the canals are as follows:\nSingel\nSingel encircled the medieval city of Amsterdam. It served as a moat around the city from 1480 until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond Singel. The canal runs from the IJ bay, near Central Station, to the Muntplein square, where it meets the Amstel river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals.

The 11.5-km (7-mile) canal was built between 1390 and 1398 to enable water transport of salt from the L\u00FCneburg region to L\u00FCbeck, capital of the Hanseatic League and an important trading centre on the Baltic Sea.
\n                            The Schwarzenberg canal, one of central Europes most important logging canals, winds its way through the picturesque Bohemian Forest. \n\nThe logging canal was built more than 200 years ago and was used for rafting timber to Vienna. It crosses the watershed between the Danube and the Elbe rivers and required the construction of the first tunnel in central Europe.\n\nIn the St Oswald area the canal has been well preserved up to the present day and the water still thunders town the rocks with unbridled power. \n\n Opening Hours:  Open all day.  \n\nOthers: parking, Sanitary Facilities, Coach Car Parks, Caf\u00E9, Restaurant \n\nLanguages: German, Czech \n\n Suitable for: Families, Groups, Seniors   \n\nContact:  \nGemeinde St. Oswald bei Haslach \nSt. Oswald 18\n4170 St. Oswald bei Haslach, Austria\n\n Tel.: +43(7289)7155512  \nFax: +43(7289)715559\n\n E-Mail: koenigseder@lichtenau.ooe.gv.at                    
\n  Lake Washington Ship Canal,\u00A0waterway, Seattle, Washington, U.S., 8 miles (13 km) long, with a minimum depth of 28.5 feet (8.7 metres), connecting Shilshole Bay (Puget Sound) with Lake Washington, passing through Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Union Bay. The canal was constructed between 1901 and 1911 in order to carry coal from mining districts east of Lake Washington to shipping points in Puget Sound. The locks near the west end of the canal, which overcome the difference of 26 feet (8 metres) between water levels, can accommodate ships up to 760 feet (230 metres) long; the locks are maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A fish ladder constructed in 1917 to accommodate anadromous fish in the regions waterways was replaced by a new structurecomplete with a public viewing galleryin 1976.

\n  Nhue Giang River,\u00A0Vietnamese Song Nhue Giang,\u00A0 canal flowing north-south for about 70 miles (113 km) through the Ha DongPhu Ly region of northern Vietnam. It was built just before World War II by the French colonial government to regulate the flow of water in the wet-rice farming area south of Hanoi, which covers about 425 square miles (1,100 square km) between the Red River (Song Hong) and the Day River. The creation of the canal and of the large Day River barrage, 853 feet (260 metres) wide, ensured what is known to the Vietnamese as a tenth-month (i.e., autumn) harvest by draining the water. Irrigation water for fifth-month (spring) crops is supplied by a catch basin and distributed via the canal.
\n  Midi Canal,\u00A0also called Languedoc Canal, French Canal du Midi or Canal du Languedoc,\u00A0 historic canal in the Languedoc region of France, a major link in the inland waterway system from the Bay of Biscay of the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. It was built in the 17th century at a time when France was the centre of civil engineering excellence. The Midi Canal connects Toulouse, using water from an artificial reservoir built in the Montagne Noire (Black Mountain), with the Mediterranean at S\u00E8te via the \u00C9tang de Thau (Thau Lagoon). On its 240-km (149-mile) journey, the Midi Canal first rises 63 metres (206 feet), via 26 locks, on its 51.5-km (32-mile) stretch from Toulouse to its 5-km- (3-mile-) long summit, then descends 189 metres (620 feet) in 183.5 km (114 miles) by 74 locks to \u00C9tang de Thau. Following World War II, the canal became important for leisure boating, for which reason it is now the most heavily used canal in France. The Midi Canal was Europes first long-distance canal and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996.
