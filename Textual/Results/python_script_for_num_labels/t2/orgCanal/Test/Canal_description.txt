\n  New York State Canal System,\u00A0formerly (191892) New York State Barge Canal, or Barge Canal,\u00A0 system of state-owned, state-operated waterways, 524 miles (843 km) in length, linking the Hudson River with Lake Erie, with extensions to Lakes Ontario and Champlain and Cayuga and Seneca lakes (in the Finger Lakes region). It incorporates the Erie Canal, from Troy via Rochester to Tonawanda, north of Buffalo; the Champlain Canal, which joins the Erie Canal at Waterford and extends north to Whitehall; the Oswego Canal, which connects the Erie Canal at Three Rivers (just north of Syracuse) and enters Lake Ontario at Oswego; and Cayuga and Seneca lakes, connecting these at Montezuma with the Erie Canal. It can accommodate barges 300 feet (91 metres) long, 43.5 feet (13 metres) wide, with a draft of 12 feet (3.7 metres) and a cargo capacity of 2,200 tons (2,000 metric tons). Authorized in 1903, it was completed in 1918. By the 1980s commercial shipping had declined because of the increased use of pipeline, rail, and bulk truck-carrying facilities. The canal system has, however, become popular for pleasure boating.

\n  OderHavel Canal,\u00A0German waterway northeast of Berlin, linking the Havel and Oder rivers. It is 52 mi (83 km) long, 108 ft (33 m) wide, and 6 1/2 ft deep, and is navigable for vessels of up to 1,000 tons. Originally called the Hohenzollern Canal, it was built in 190814 to carry traffic between Berlin on the Havel and the Baltic Sea port of Stettin (Szczecin, Pol.) at the mouth of the Oder. It declined in importance until 1945 but then revived with the growth of a chemical industry at Schwedt, on the eastern part of the canal near the Polish border.

\n                            \n                  \n                    The Suez Canal, also known by the nickname \"The Highway to India\", is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work, it allows transportation by water between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa. The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfik at the city of Suez. Ismailia lies on its West Bank, 3 km (1.9 mi) north of the half-way point.\n\u00A0\nWhen first built, the canal was 164 km (102 mi) long and 8 m (26 ft) deep. After multiple enlargements, the canal is 193.30 km (120.11 mi) long, 24 m (79 ft) deep and 205 metres (673 ft) wide as of 2010. It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km/14 mi, the canal itself of 162.25 km/100.82 mi and the southern access channel of 9 km/5.6 mi. The canal is single lane with passing places in Ballah By-Pass and in the Great Bitter Lake. It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal. In general, the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez.\n\u00A0\nThe canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) of Egypt. Under international treaty, it may be used \"in time of war as in time of peace, by every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag.\"                  \n                \n                    
\n  Sirhind Canal,\u00A0canal in Punjab state, northwestern India. It opened in 1882 and consists of an extensive canal system that irrigates more than 2,000 square miles (5,200 square km) of farmland. The systems headworks, where it draws its water, are on the Sutlej River at Ropar, near the border of Himchal Pradesh state. From there the canal runs west-southwest to Dorha, where it splits into three branches. One flows west and then northwest to rejoin the Sutlej near the Pakistan border; one runs southwest past Bathinda to the border of Rjasthn state; and the third flows southeast to Patila. There are many distributaries, in addition to the three principal branches.

\n  North Sea Canal,\u00A0Dutch Noordzeekanaal,\u00A0 waterway in the Netherlands that extends in an east-west direction between Amsterdam and IJmuiden on the North Sea coast. Its construction was first proposed in 1852; work started in 1865; and the canal opened in 1876. It has been enlarged several times. Navigable by 90,000-ton oceangoing vessels, the canal is 24 km (15 miles) long, 15 metres (49 feet) deep, and 235 metres (771 feet) wide. It gave Amsterdam access to the sea and made it a major port. The sea locks at IJmuiden were destroyed during World War II but were later rebuilt; the largest is now 400 metres (1,300 feet) long by 50 metres (160 feet) wide.

\n  Albert Canal,\u00A0waterway connecting the cities of Antwerp and Li\u00E8ge in Belgium. The Albert Canal is about 130 km (80 miles) long. As completed in 1939, it had a minimum bottom width of 24 metres (80 feet) and could be navigated by 2,000-ton vessels having a maximum draft of 2.7 metres (9 feet). Enlargement of the canal began in 1960, and it can now handle push-tow units of 9,000 tons with a draft of 3.4 metres (11 feet). Traversing a highly industrialized area, the canal has six sets of triple locks and one single lock at Monsin (Li\u00E8ge), the fall from Li\u00E8ge to Antwerp being 56 metres (184 feet).

\n  Grand Canal dAlsace,\u00A0English Great Alsace Canal,\u00A0 waterway along the Rhine River, in eastern France, designed in 1922. The first section, at Kembs, opened in 1932, and three more pairs of locks were built between 1952 and 1959. The canal is now 50 km (30 miles) long and runs between Basel, Switz., and Breisach, Ger. It was built to improve navigation of the Rhine (hindered by shallows and a rapid current) and thus to increase traffic upstream from Strasbourg. Electricity is generated at the locks, the largest of each pair being 185 by 23 metres (600 by 75 feet).
\n  Subei Canal,\u00A0Chinese (Pinyin) Subei Guangai Zong Qu or (Wade-Giles romanization) Su-pei-kuan-kai-tsung Ch\u00FC, English Northern Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal,\u00A0 canal in Jiangsu province, eastern China, designed to provide a direct outlet to the sea for the waters of the Huai River, which discharged near the mouth of the Guan River. In the late 12th century ad the Huang He (Yellow River) changed its course to discharge south of the Shandong Peninsula, thus taking over the lower course of the Huai, which thereafter discharged into Hongze Lake and thence southward through a string of lakes and waterways into the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) near Yangzhou (Jiangsu). The Huang He remained in that course until the 1850s, when it again shifted to its present course north of the Shandong Peninsula. In the early 20th century the drainage of the Huai area had become a perennial problem. A canal linking Hongze Lake with the sea was constructed in 193437, designed not only as a channel for the discharge of floodwaters but also as the main artery of an extensive network of drainage and irrigation channels. However, the destruction of levees in 1938 during the Sino-Japanese War again temporarily shifted the Huang He into the Huai, in the process inundating a vast region and causing massive damage. After 1950 the main Subei Canal linking the Huai River with the sea was largely rebuilt and was incorporated into a waterway system covering the coastal belt of Jiangsu north of the Yangtze, which was designated as the Subei Irrigation District.
\n  Elbe-L\u00FCbeck Canal,\u00A0German Elbe-L\u00FCbeck-Kanal or Elbe-Trave-Kanal,\u00A0 German waterway connecting the Elbe River at Lauenberg with the Baltic Sea at L\u00FCbeck. The waterway, 64 km (40 miles) long, was built in 18951900 to replace the medieval Stecknitz Canal.

\n  Grand Canal,\u00A0Chinese (Pinyin) Da Yunhe or (Wade-Giles romanization) Ta Y\u00FCn-ho, also called Jing-Hang Yunhe (Beijing-Hangzhou Canal),\u00A0 series of waterways in eastern and northern China that link Hangzhou in Zhejiang province with Beijing. Some 1,100 miles (1,800 km) in length, it is the worlds longest man-made waterway, though, strictly speaking, not all of it is a canal. It was built to enable successive Chinese regimes to transport surplus grain from the agriculturally rich Yangtze (Chang) and Huai river valleys to feed the capital cities and large standing armies in northern China.

\n  Chesapeake and Delaware Canal,\u00A0 American waterway 14 miles (22 km) long connecting the head of the Chesapeake Bay with the Delaware River estuary. The canal cuts across the narrow northern neck of the 180-mile- (290-kilometre-) long Delmarva Peninsula, thereby providing shortened northern and European routes from the Atlantic Ocean to Baltimore. Completed in 1829, the privately owned canal operated with locks until 1919, when the United States government bought it and converted it to a tidal, toll-free waterway 27 feet (8 m) deep. Between 1962 and 1981 the waterway was deepened to 35 feet (11 m) and widened to 450 feet (137 m) to accommodate container ships.
\n  Volga-Don Canal,\u00A0Russian Volgo-Donskoy Sudokhodny Kanal,\u00A0 canal linking the lower Volga River with the Don River at their closest point in southwestern Russia. The canal runs from Kalach-na-Donu, on the eastern shore of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir, for 101 km (63 miles) to Krasnoarmeysk on the Volga immediately south of Volgograd. There are 13 locks along its route, which drops 88 metres (289 feet) to the Volga and 44 metres (144 feet) to the Don. Three reservoirsKarpovka, Bereslavka, and Varvarovkaoccupy 45 km (28 miles) of its length.

Building commenced in 1831 and the canal opened in 1843. It served as a major commercial route during a time of heightened trade between the United States and Canada. Trade dwindled after World War I, and as of the 1970s, traffic has been replaced by recreational vessels.\n\nIt is part of a waterway that connects the Saint Lawrence River with the Hudson River in the United States. Lake Champlain and the Champlain Canal form the U.S. portion of the Lakes to Locks Passage. The Canal has 10 bridges - 8 of which are hand operated - and one hydraulic locks.\n\nDetails:\n\n    \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Draft: 6.5 ft (1.98 m)\n    \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Clearance: 29 ft (8.84 m)\n    \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Canal Length: 12 mi (18.96 km)\n    \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Dimensions of smallest lock: 110 ft x 21 ft (33.52 x 7m)\n    \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Passage time: 3 to 5 hours\n                  \n                \n                    
\n  Grand Canal,\u00A0Italian Canale Grande,\u00A0 main waterway of Venice, Italy, following a natural channel that traces a reverse-S course from San Marco Basilica to Santa Chiara Church and divides the city into two parts.
\n  Ling Canal,\u00A0Chinese (Pinyin) Ling Qu or (Wade-Giles romanization) Ling Ch\u00FC,\u00A0 canal in the northern part of the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi, southeastern China. The Ling Canal was constructed to connect the headwaters of the Xiang River, flowing north into Hunan province, with the Li River, one of the headwater tributaries of the Gui River, which is a tributary of the Xi River leading eventually to Guangzhou (Canton). Near the city of Xingan in northern Guangxi, these two rivers are separated by a low divide broken by a saddle. A contour canal was built leading water diverted from the Xiang along some 3 miles (5 km) of gentle gradient into the Li. Below the point at which the water for the canal was diverted, another waterway, the Bei Canal, some 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long, diverted the waters of the Xiang itself to provide a better channel. The main section of the canal joining the two rivers was called the Nan Canal. The course of the Li, unsuited in its natural state for navigation, was canalized for some 17 miles (27 km) to its junction with the Gui.

\n  Trekvaart,\u00A0system of canals in the Low Countries, built in the 17th century and used exclusively by boats carrying passengers and parcels. The system of canals connected the main towns and cities of the area, its construction and operation being organized by local authorities. Newly built sections usually followed a straight line between towns, and other sections were reconstructions of older waterways. A towpath was provided in order for trekschuiten (passenger boats) to be pulled by horse at an average of 7 km (4.5 miles) per hour. The boats, about 15 metres (50 feet) in length and 2.5 metres (8 feet) in breadth, could carry some 30 people.
