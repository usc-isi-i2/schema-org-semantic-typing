Its perfect for our home
I was in a antique shop in Burlington, WI this past fall, and the owner had these prints on the wall behind the register(not for sale). I fell in love with them. This was my second purchase from posters2prints. I will be completing this series in the next couple of months. Your site is user-friendly and offers a variety of framing choices. I have been very happy. Thanks for the good work!
It looked exactly like the site. Very well constructed and elegant looking
Good quality and the frame color and material were spot-on what I wanted.
I ordered this for my bathroom remodel.  It's perfect! I'm extremely happy with the way it turned out, and I'm sure it will make my bathroom look very elegant when the remodel is complete.  Thanks.
Custom made mirrors were a MUST for me because they were placed in close proximity, but are of different dimensions.  I am VERY pleased. By the way, Posters2Prints,  you really know how to package your product for shipping!
It fits the style of our master bathroom renovation
Thank you sooooo much for the beautiful job you did in framing and mailing the artwork!\"Snow Angels\" really brightens up my kitchen area. I chose the ansley cherry frame for the \"Snow Angel\" because I have a granddaughter named Ansley.Every once in awhile it snows in Texas and I\"m looking forward to making snow angels with my 3 grandkids when it does. If I knew how to send pics by e-mail I would but I\"m \"technically challenged\". Sincerely, a very happy customer
